# Interpreting and checking tool 2.0 (project under development)
The Interpreting and checking tool 2.0 is an add-on of the Catalogue browser.
The new version is based on Java programming language and mainly improve the performance and the general usage in compare with the previous version written in VBA.
In addition the tool simply uses the same BRs used in the CB sharing the same code.

## Dependencies
All project dependencies are listed in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file.

## Import the project
In order to import the project correctly into the integrated development environment (e.g. Eclipse), it is necessary to download the project together with all its dependencies.
The project and all its dependencies are based on the concept of "project object model" and hence Apache Maven is used for the specific purpose.
In order to correctly import the project into the IDE it is firstly required to create a parent POM Maven project (check the following [link](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html) for further information). 
Once the parent project has been created add the project and all the dependencies as "modules" into the pom.xml file as shown below: 

	<modules>

		<!-- dependency modules -->
		<module>module_1</module>
		...
		...
		...
		<module>module_n</module>
		
	</modules>
	
Next, close the IDE and extract all the zip packets inside the parent project.
At this stage you can simply open the IDE and import back the parent project which will automatically import also the project and all its dependencies.

_Please note that the "SWT.jar" and the "Jface.jar" libraries (if used) must be downloaded and installed manually in the Maven local repository since are custom versions used in the tool ((install 3rd party jars)[https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html]). 
Download the exact version by checking the Catalogue browser pom.xml file._
